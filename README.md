The study aims to decipher the future forecasting of Temperature for India. 
I have downloaded the global Dataset for temperature from Earth Observatory Website and pre-processed
cleaned the data to focus mainly on the target country-‘India”.
For Data visualisation I’ve tried to bring a global chloropleth map in idea using the internet. 
For this Time series Forecasting I have used Arima Model.
